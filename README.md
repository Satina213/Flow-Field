This is the first thing I am uploading on purpose to github. I am trying to learn the system so forgive me for any mishaps.

This is, should be, a visualization, a cool something, of a bunch of particles flowing through a flow field. 
The flowfield is generated by perlin noise, where each frame in time is a 2-D slize of a 3-D field of perlin noise values.
This is based off of the Coding Train's coding live stream #46
